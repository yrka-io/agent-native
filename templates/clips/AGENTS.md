# Clips — Agent Guide

Clips is an agent-native screen-recording app. The agent and UI are equal partners: every library search, every transcript edit, every share-link tweak, every new Clip is something both the user and the agent can do — via the same actions, against the same SQL database, synced in real time by the framework's polling layer. This guide is how you (the agent) operate inside this app. See the root `AGENTS.md` for the framework-wide rules.

**Naming:** always call a recording a **"Clip"** in any user-facing string or agent message. Never use the word "Loom". Internal table / variable names (`recordings`, `recording_transcripts`, etc.) stay as-is.

**Core philosophy.** Users record videos, the app transcribes them, the agent then assists: suggests titles, writes summaries, builds chapters, removes filler words, finds the exact moment someone said X, opens the right recording, shares it with the right teammate, answers comments. The agent can do any of this without ever leaving the chat — because the UI exposes what the user is seeing via `application_state`, and every operation is a first-class action.

**Context is automatic.** The current screen state (navigation + recording metadata) is included with each message as a `<current-screen>` block. You don't need to call `view-screen` before every action. Use `view-screen` when you need a refreshed snapshot (e.g. after editing a recording, adding a comment, or changing views).

## Resources

Resources are SQL-backed persistent files for notes, learnings, and context.

**At the start of every conversation, read these resources (both personal and shared scopes):**

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — user-specific context like how the user names recordings, which teammates exist, and team preferences. Read both `--scope personal` and `--scope shared`.
2. **`LEARNINGS.md`** — the app's memory with user preferences, corrections, and patterns. Read both scopes.

**Update `LEARNINGS.md` when you learn something important** — user corrects your tone, shares preferences, or reveals a non-obvious pattern. Keep entries concise and grouped.

| Action            | Args                                           | Purpose                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `resource-read`   | `--path <path> [--scope personal\|shared]`     | Read a resource         |
| `resource-write`  | `--path <path> --content <text> [--scope ...]` | Write/update a resource |
| `resource-list`   | `[--scope personal\|shared]`                   | List all resources      |
| `resource-delete` | `--path <path> [--scope personal\|shared]`     | Delete a resource       |

## Data Sources

All structured data lives in SQL via Drizzle ORM — **dialect-agnostic** (Neon Postgres in production, SQLite for local). See `server/db/schema.ts` for full column definitions. This is the summary:

Team / tenant data lives in the framework's better-auth `organization` tables. Clips-specific data (spaces, folders, recordings, etc.) hangs off `organization_id` FKs.

| Table                        | Holds                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `organization` (better-auth) | Team. Name, slug, logo. Managed by the framework — created via better-auth (or the `create-organization` action). |
| `member` (better-auth)       | Who belongs to each org and their role (`owner` / `admin` / `member`).                                            |
| `invitation` (better-auth)   | Pending org invites.                                                                                              |
| `organization_settings`      | Clips-specific org sidecar: `brand_color`, `brand_logo_url`, `default_visibility`. Keyed by `organization.id`.    |
| `spaces`                     | Topic spaces inside an org (engineering, design, etc.). FK: `organization_id`.                                    |
| `space_members`              | Who can see/post to each space.                                                                                   |
| `folders`                    | Library folders (nest via `parent_id`, scoped to space or personal). FK: `organization_id`.                       |
| `recordings`                 | The core resource. Title, video URL, duration, status, edits JSON, etc. FK: `organization_id`.                    |
| `recording_shares`           | Per-user / per-org share grants via framework `sharing`.                                                          |
| `recording_tags`             | Free-form tags. FK: `organization_id`.                                                                            |
| `recording_transcripts`      | Whisper output — segments JSON + fullText + status.                                                               |
| `recording_ctas`             | Call-to-action buttons (label, URL, placement).                                                                   |
| `recording_comments`         | Threaded comments with `video_timestamp_ms` + emoji reactions JSON. FK: `organization_id`.                        |
| `recording_reactions`        | Emoji reactions tied to a video timestamp.                                                                        |
| `recording_viewers`          | One row per viewer: watch total, completed %, whether the view counted.                                           |
| `recording_events`           | Granular events: view-start, watch-progress, seek, pause, cta-click, etc.                                         |

> Older schemas had Clips-specific `workspaces` / `workspace_members` / `invites` tables. Those have been **replaced** by better-auth's `organization` / `member` / `invitation` tables — any references you see to "workspace" in older code or data are deprecated aliases for "organization".

Visibility and sharing use the framework `sharing` system — recordings are registered as a shareable resource in `server/db/index.ts` via `registerShareableResource({ type: "recording", ... })`. Use the auto-mounted `share-resource` / `set-resource-visibility` / `list-resource-shares` actions (see Sharing below). Password and `expiresAt` are **extra** privacy controls on top of framework visibility — they're in the `recordings` table.

## Application State

Ephemeral UI state lives in `application_state`, accessed via `readAppState(key)` / `writeAppState(key, value)` from `@agent-native/core/application-state`. The UI syncs here so the agent always knows what's on screen.

| State Key         | Purpose                                                                         | Direction               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `navigation`      | Current view + selected IDs (see shape below)                                   | UI -> Agent (read-only) |
| `navigate`        | One-shot navigation command (auto-deleted after UI reads)                       | Agent -> UI             |
| `refresh-signal`  | Bump timestamp — invalidates lists (recordings, comments, etc.)                 | Agent -> UI             |
| `record-intent`   | Request that the UI start a new recording (mode: `screen` / `camera`)           | Agent -> UI             |
| `recording-setup` | Current `/record` mode, selected mic/camera labels, and mic/camera check status | UI -> Agent (read-only) |
| `player-state`    | Current video time, playing, speed — set by the player                          | UI -> Agent (read-only) |
| `editor-draft`    | In-progress non-destructive edits for the recording being edited                | Bidirectional           |
| `selection`       | User's current text selection inside transcript or comment                      | UI -> Agent (read-only) |

> Active organization lives in the better-auth session (`session.activeOrganizationId`), **not** in application state. An older `current-workspace` app-state key is deprecated. To switch orgs, use `useSwitchOrg()` on the client or better-auth's `setActiveOrganization` API. The previous session's active org is restored automatically on login.

### Navigation state shape

```json
{
  "view": "library",
  "recordingId": "rec_abc",
  "spaceId": "spc_xyz",
  "folderId": "fld_123",
  "shareId": "shr_888",
  "search": "onboarding"
}
```

Views: `library`, `spaces`, `space`, `archive`, `trash`, `record`, `recording`, `share`, `embed`, `insights`, `notifications`, `settings`.

**Do NOT write to `navigation`** — it is overwritten by the UI. To navigate, write to `navigate` via the `navigate` action.

## Common Tasks

| User request                                        | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "What am I looking at?"                             | `pnpm action view-screen`                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| "Start a screen recording"                          | `pnpm action navigate --view=record` — then the user picks a mode and hits Start. Recording is a UI gesture (MediaRecorder needs user consent) — see Rule 10.                                                         |
| "Stop recording"                                    | Stop is a UI gesture. Users press the stop button in the recording toolbar.                                                                                                                                           |

After any recording mutation (rename, move, edit, archive, delete, add comment, etc.) the actions trigger a UI refresh automatically via `refresh-signal`.

## Actions

**Always use `pnpm action <name>` for all operations.** Scripts handle validation, access checks, and refresh signals. Never use `curl`, raw HTTP, or raw SQL (`db-exec`) for recording operations.

**Running actions from the frame.** The terminal cwd is the framework root. Always `cd` first:

```bash
cd templates/clips && pnpm action <name> [args]
```

`.env` is loaded automatically — **never manually set `DATABASE_URL` or other env vars**.

> **Note on param names.** Most actions that reference a recording use `recordingId`. A handful of lifecycle actions (`archive-recording`, `trash-recording`, `restore-recording`, `update-recording`, `finalize-recording`, `delete-recording-permanent`) use `id` because they're CRUD on the recording row itself. Use what each table below says. When unsure, `ls actions/` and open the relevant file — its Zod schema is the source of truth.

### Recording lifecycle

Start / stop / pause are **UI gestures** — there is no server action. MediaRecorder needs an explicit user click (permission + user-activation). The agent sends the user to `/record` via `navigate --view=record`, the user picks the mode and hits Start.

### Call-to-Actions (CTAs)

| Action       | Args                                                               | Purpose                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `create-cta` | `--recordingId <id> --label <text> --url <url> [--placement <ms>]` | Add a CTA button to a recording |
| `update-cta` | `--id <id> [--label <text>] [--url <url>] [--placement <ms>]`      | Update an existing CTA          |
| `delete-cta` | `--id <id>`                                                        | Remove a CTA                    |

### Sharing (framework-wide, auto-mounted)

| Action                    | Args                                                                                                                                                                          | Purpose                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `share-resource`          | `--resourceType recording --resourceId <id> --principalType user\|org --principalId <email-or-orgId> --role viewer\|editor\|admin --notify true\|false --resourceUrl /r/<id>` | Grant a user or org access           |
| `unshare-resource`        | `--resourceType recording --resourceId <id> --principalType user\|org --principalId <value>`                                                                                  | Revoke a share grant                 |
| `list-resource-shares`    | `--resourceType recording --resourceId <id>`                                                                                                                                  | Show current visibility + all grants |
| `set-resource-visibility` | `--resourceType recording --resourceId <id> --visibility private\|org\|public`                                                                                                | Change coarse visibility             |

Password + `expiresAt` are **additions** stored directly on the recording row — they compose with the framework share grants. See the `video-sharing` skill.

Public share link: `/share/<recordingId>`. Embed: `/embed/<recordingId>`. Both require `visibility=public`.

### Comments + reactions

| Action               | Args                                                                                      | Purpose                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `list-comments`      | `--recordingId <id>`                                                                      | List threaded comments with timestamps |

| `resolve-comment`    | `--id <commentId>`                                                                        | Mark a thread resolved                 |
| `delete-comment`     | `--id <commentId>`                                                                        | Delete a comment                       |

### Analytics

| Action                      | Args                           | Purpose                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list-viewers`              | `--recordingId <id> [--limit]` | Viewers + watch totals + whether their view counted.     |
| `get-recording-insights`    | `--recordingId <id>`           | Aggregate: views, completion %, drop-off curve, CTA CTR. |
| `get-organization-insights` |                                | Aggregate analytics for the active organization.         |
| `export-insights-csv`       | `--recordingId <id>`           | Download insights for a recording as CSV.                |

Granular per-event recording (view-start / watch-progress / seek / pause / cta-click) is a custom HTTP route at `POST /api/view-event`, not an action — the player hits it directly.

### Organization + invites

Teams in Clips are better-auth organizations. Membership, roles, and invitations live on the framework `organization` / `member` / `invitation` tables. The actions below are thin Clips-specific wrappers that operate on those tables.

| Action                      | Args                                    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list-organization-state`   |                                         | Roster + spaces + folders summary for the active organization.                                                                                                                   |
| `create-organization`       | `--name <name> [--slug] [--brandColor]` | Create a new organization (delegates to better-auth, seeds `organization_settings`).                                                                                             |
| `set-organization-branding` | `--brandColor <hex> [--brandLogoUrl]`   | Update the active organization's `organization_settings` row (brand color / logo).                                                                                               |
| `invite-member`             | `--email <e> [--role admin\|member]`    | Send an invite. Roles use better-auth's `admin` / `member` model. Legacy Clips roles (`viewer`, `creator-lite`, `creator`) are still accepted by the action and map to `member`. |
| `update-member-role`        | `--email <e> --role <r>`                | Change an existing member's role.                                                                                                                                                |
| `remove-member`             | `--email <e>`                           | Remove a member from the organization.                                                                                                                                           |
| `get-invite`                | `--token <t>`                           | Look up a pending invite.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `accept-invite`             | `--token <t>`                           | Accept a pending invite.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `decline-invite`            | `--token <t>`                           | Decline a pending invite.                                                                                                                                                        |

> **Switching orgs.** There is no `set-current-workspace` action — the active org lives in the better-auth session. From the client use `useSwitchOrg().mutate({ organizationId })`; server-side use better-auth's `setActiveOrganization` API.

### Navigation + context

| Action               | Args                                                                                     | Purpose                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `view-screen`        |                                                                                          | Snapshot of what the user is looking at now |
| `navigate`           | `--view <name> [--recordingId] [--spaceId] [--folderId] [--shareId] [--search] [--path]` | Navigate the UI                             |
| `refresh-list`       |                                                                                          | Bump the `refresh-signal` timestamp         |
| `list-notifications` |                                                                                          | List the current user's notifications       |

## API Routes

Custom routes only exist for things actions can't do well — file uploads (binary body), high-frequency event writes, and third-party webhooks. Everything else is an action.

| Method | Route                   | Purpose                                                   |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/uploads/chunk`    | Receive a MediaRecorder chunk (append to current upload)  |
| POST   | `/api/uploads/complete` | Finalize upload — sets `recordings.status = processing`   |
| GET    | `/api/video/:id`        | Stream the video bytes (respects `visibility` / shares)   |
| GET    | `/api/thumbnail/:id`    | Return static thumbnail                                   |
| POST   | `/api/view-event`       | Record a watch-progress / seek / pause / cta-click event  |
| POST   | `/api/webhooks/whisper` | Webhook for async Whisper completion (updates transcript) |

All standard CRUD (list, get, create, update) goes through `/_agent-native/actions/:name` — use `useActionQuery` / `useActionMutation` from the client.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

## UI Components

- **shadcn/ui only** for all standard patterns (dialogs, popovers, dropdowns, tooltips, buttons). Never build custom modals or positioned overlays by hand.
- **Tabler Icons only** (`@tabler/icons-react`). No other icon libraries. Do **not** use robot or sparkle icons to represent the agent / AI.
- **Never** use `window.confirm`, `window.alert`, or `window.prompt`. Use shadcn `AlertDialog`.
- **Inter font** for all UI.
- **Monochrome aesthetic.** Default space/folder/org color is `#18181B` (neutral zinc-900). Brand color is user-customizable via `set-organization-branding` (stored in `organization_settings`).
- **1.2x** is the default playback speed for every recording (stored in `recordings.default_speed`).
- **Keep shadcn default transitions** (animate-in/out, fade, zoom, slide). Avoid custom decorative transitions — keep the UI snappy.

## Rules

1. **All AI goes through the agent chat unless it is a narrow media-pipeline exception.** Call `sendToAgentChat({ background: true, context, message })` from UI or actions for summaries, chapters, edits, tags, and conversational work. Do **not** `import OpenAI` / `@anthropic-ai/sdk`. See the `ai-video-tools` skill.
2. **Native transcript first, always.** The browser's Web Speech API and desktop macOS Speech capture transcripts during recording and save them through `save-browser-transcript`. The UI should show that native transcript immediately. Title generation uses the Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite cleanup/title path (`cleanup-transcript` task=`title`) from the native text and must not wait for cloud speech-to-text. Title and cleanup prompts include the native transcript plus any available shared/org and personal `AGENTS.md` resources so naming and cleanup preferences can influence the result. Transcript cleanup is optional, runs in the background, and should never hide or replace a ready native transcript with a failure state. If cleanup fails, keep the native transcript and log the full provider details for debugging.
3. **Cloud transcription is fallback-only and never OpenAI for Clips recordings.** `request-transcript` may try **Builder Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite** (via Builder.io Connect / `BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY`) or **Groq** (`whisper-large-v3-turbo`) only when no native transcript exists. Do not route Clips recording transcription to OpenAI or ask the user for an OpenAI key for Clips transcripts.
4. **Edits are non-destructive.** Never re-encode on edit. Every trim/cut/split/blur/speed change is appended to `recordings.edits_json`. The player applies edits live; `export-video` only renders when the user explicitly exports. See `video-editing`.
5. **View-counting rule.** A view counts when the viewer hits **≥ 5 seconds** OR **≥ 75% completion** OR scrubs to the end. `shouldCountView` in `server/lib/recordings.ts` is the canonical check — always go through it.
6. **Use the framework sharing system.** Never write custom share tables for recordings. `registerShareableResource({ type: "recording", ... })` is already wired in `server/db/index.ts`. Compose with the auto-mounted actions. Add password + `expiresAt` as **additional** checks in the share-resolution path, not replacements. See `video-sharing`.
7. **SQL must be dialect-agnostic.** The target is Neon Postgres. Use Drizzle operators only. No SQLite-specific functions (`datetime('now')`, `|| ''`), no `json_extract`, no `ROWID`. Use `now()` from `@agent-native/core/db/schema`. See the `portability` skill.
8. **Screen context is auto-included.** Check `<current-screen>` in the user's message before running `view-screen` — you usually don't need to call it.
9. **Trigger refresh after mutations.** `writeAppState("refresh-signal", { ts: Date.now() })` — `useDbSync` invalidates the affected query keys. Most actions do this automatically.
10. **Scoping.** All list/get actions filter via `accessFilter(schema.recordings, schema.recordingShares)`. Write actions guard via `assertAccess("recording", id, "editor")` (or `"admin"` for delete).
11. **No pre-recording state without consent.** Never start the MediaRecorder without an explicit user gesture — `start-recording` only writes `record-intent`; the UI is responsible for prompting for camera/mic permissions.

## Authentication

This template uses the framework's default auth — Better Auth, with email/password and optional Google / GitHub social providers. Better Auth's organization plugin owns the team primitives (`organization` / `member` / `invitation` tables, see [Team & Recordings Data Model](#team--recordings-data-model)). Use `getSession(event)` server-side and `useSession()` client-side; per-user scoping inside actions / handlers reads `getRequestUserEmail()` from `@agent-native/core/server/request-context`.

See the `authentication` skill for the full mode matrix (`AUTH_MODE=local`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `AUTH_DISABLED`, BYOA) and the `security` skill for the access-control model (`ownableColumns`, `accessFilter`, `assertAccess`).

## Meetings & Dictate

Clips has a **Meetings** tab (`/meetings`) and a **Dictate** tab (`/dictate`):

- **Meetings** lists upcoming + past meetings from live Google Calendar reads, with a two-pane detail view: live transcript (left) + AI summary / bullets / per-attendee action items (right). Use `list-meetings`, `get-meeting`, `finalize-meeting`, `connect-calendar`, `delete-meeting`, etc. Navigation state exposes `view: "meetings" | "meeting"` and `meetingId`; `view-screen` includes `calendarAccounts` health so agents can distinguish an empty calendar from `needs-reauth` / fetch failures. The visible Meetings UI is calendar-sourced only: no "New meeting" CTA.
- **Dictate** is the press-and-hold/browser dictation history: every Hold-Fn, Cmd+Shift+Space, or in-browser dictation is saved as a row, expandable to show original + AI-cleaned text. Use `create-dictation`, `list-dictations`, `cleanup-dictation`. Navigation state exposes `view: "dictate"` and `dictationId`.

**Audio capture: mic + system, tagged.** Meeting capture records two streams (`mic` and `system`) and tags every transcript segment with its `source`, so per-attendee action items can attribute speech to remote attendees. Mic-only recordings make remote attendees silent — call this out whenever the user expects coverage of people on the other end of a Zoom/Meet/Teams call. Dictations are mic-only by design.

**Bidirectional recording↔meeting link.** A meeting recording sets `meetings.recordingId` AND `recordings.meeting_id`, so a recording opened from the Library can also be recognized as a meeting (and vice versa). When a recording row's `meeting_id` is non-null, both the Clips and Meetings answers are valid.

**Calendar reminders fire 5 minutes before the meeting starts.** The desktop tray (`desktop/src-tauri/`) polls the live `list-meetings` action and filters locally for near-start reminders; `calendar_events` is only a snapshot/materialization table for meetings that have been recorded or edited. Agents do not need to schedule reminders manually.

**Desktop launch at login is on by default.** The tray app persists this as `launchAtLoginEnabled` in `feature-config.json`, syncs it through Tauri's autostart plugin during native startup, and exposes it in Settings as "Open at login".

See the `meetings` skill for the full pattern (Granola design ref, view-screen shape, agent-callable flows) and the `dictate` skill for the press-and-hold UX (Wispr design ref, Hold-Fn ownership, cleanup pipeline). The shared Gemini Flash-Lite cleanup pipeline (`cleanup-transcript`) leads with **Builder.io Connect (primary)** and falls back to **BYOK Gemini (secondary)**. Cleanup does not route to Groq or OpenAI — those are transcription providers, not cleanup providers.
