/**
 * Collab-aware "ingest the final" read for external agents.
 *
 * The `documents.content` column can lag behind a live Yjs collab session: the
 * editor holds the authoritative Y.XmlFragment in memory and only debounces it
 * back to SQL via `update-document`. To hand an external agent the document the
 * user actually sees, we ask the OPEN editor to flush instead of duplicating a
 * ProseMirror -> markdown serializer server-side:
 *
 *   1. If a collab session exists for this doc, write a one-shot
 *      `flush-request-<id>` app-state key under the DOCUMENT OWNER's session
 *      (and, for back-compat, the caller's own session). The open editor polls
 *      `/_agent-native/application-state/flush-request-<id>`, which the
 *      framework scopes to the *logged-in browser user* — i.e. the human with
 *      the editor open, which is the document owner. Scoping the write to the
 *      external agent caller's session (the old behavior) meant the editor
 *      never saw the key, so every external `pull-document` waited the full
 *      timeout and returned stale DB content.
 *   2. The editor polls that key, serializes its current Y.Doc to markdown
 *      through its existing serializer, calls `update-document`, then deletes
 *      the key.
 *   3. We poll (across both candidate sessions) for the key to disappear
 *      (flush acknowledged) and then read the now-fresh row. If the key never
 *      clears (no editor actually open), we fall back to the DB column, which
 *      is the best available snapshot.
 *
 * When there is no live collab session the DB column is authoritative and we
 * skip the handshake entirely. The handshake itself is bounded by
 * FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS so a stale `hasCollabState` (presence lingering with no tab
 * actually open) can never hang the request longer than a few seconds.
