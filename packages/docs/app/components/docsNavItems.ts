    // To surface a new template in the docs sidebar, first flip its `hidden`
    // flag in that file. The CI guard `scripts/guard-template-list.mjs`
    // enforces this — adding a slug here that isn't in the allow-list will
    // fail the build.
    //
    // Important: this is the docs sidebar, so these links must point to the
    // markdown docs under `/docs/template-<slug>`, never the marketing/demo
    // landing pages under `/templates/<slug>`. The tests and guard script
    // intentionally enforce this because this list has regressed before.
